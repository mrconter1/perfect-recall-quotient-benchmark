# 🧠 Perfect Recall Quotient (PRQ) Benchmark

PRQ Benchmark is a benchmark designed to measure the perfect recall capabilities of large language models. Unlike traditional benchmarks, PRQ focuses specifically on a model's ability to retrieve exact information from previously read scientific papers, providing a quantitative measure of an AI's memory and recall precision.
